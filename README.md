# NeonTennis
I decided to say bugger it and open source my (current) magnum opus, Neon: Tennis. It's not 100% complete but someone might be able to find some fun from this.

### Game Description
You know what tennis needed? Explosions!

Experience the madness that is tennis, an ever growing amount of balls, Power-ups that can either either aid or impede you, and explosions. A ridiculous amount of explosions. Rally with yourself and try to keep up or (Coming Soon) play a more traditional match with you and one of your friends.
